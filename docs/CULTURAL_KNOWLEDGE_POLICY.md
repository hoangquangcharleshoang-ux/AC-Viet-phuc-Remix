# Cultural Knowledge Policy

Status: **Binding cultural-knowledge contract**

This document defines how cultural claims enter, move through, and leave the AC system.

## Authority

Approved project knowledge is the only cultural authority used by runtime product logic.

Current machine-readable source:

- `src/data/culturalKnowledgePack.ts`

Its approved upstream source is **AC — Research & Cultural Knowledge Master v1.0 FINAL**.

Research notes, chat discussions, commercial product pages, generated images, stage costumes, and model pretraining are not automatically production truth.

A future supplement becomes authoritative only after explicit approval and integration.

## Garment scope

The active MVP scope is exactly:

- `ngu_than_chen`
- `ao_tac`
- `ao_tu_than`

Do not infer rules for other garments from these profiles.

## Claim types

Keep these conceptual categories distinct:

- **SOURCE_SUPPORTED_FACT** — directly supported by suitable historical, museum, archival, or scholarly evidence.
- **REASONABLE_INTERPRETATION** — evidence-based interpretation that requires cautious wording.
- **CONTEMPORARY_STYLING_RECOMMENDATION** — a modern styling suggestion; never present it as historical practice.
- **UNKNOWN_OR_DISPUTED** — insufficient, conflicting, or unresolved evidence.

Do not silently convert one category into another.

## Evidence enum

The project evidence vocabulary is exactly:

`VERIFIED | PROBABLE | APPROXIMATE | DISPUTED | UNKNOWN`

Do not introduce alternate evidence values without an explicit migration decision.

## Claim–source fit

A source must be suitable for the exact claim being made.

Examples:

- a museum object can verify that a specific construction existed,
- one object does not automatically prove universal social practice,
- a contemporary practitioner can document current practice but cannot establish ancient historical canon alone,
- a commercial listing can prove present commercial labeling/practice, not historical use by itself.

## Absence of evidence

`No evidence found` does not mean `historically impossible`.

When a combination is not established, use language such as:

- "chưa có đủ tư liệu đã kiểm chứng",
- "chưa xác lập trong corpus hiện tại",
- "không đủ cơ sở để coi là cấu hình lịch sử mặc định".

Do not invent prohibitions from missing evidence.

## Trait taxonomy

The cultural trait categories are:

- `essential`
- `strongly_characteristic`
- `supporting`
- `variable`

These describe cultural importance, not visual assessability.

Never infer:

`essential → automatically visible`

or:

`supporting → automatically irrelevant`

Visual QA uses separate assessability policy.

## Historical vs contemporary styling

Historical evidence and modern remix guidance must remain separate.

A safe modern suggestion may be culturally acceptable without being historical.

The product may say:

> "Đây là cách phối đương đại."

It must not say:

> "Người xưa mặc như vậy."

unless approved evidence supports that historical claim.

## Wearer and styling research

Do not create new male/female garment eligibility from model intuition.

Do not infer accessory compatibility from wearer alone.

Do not hard-code a historical prohibition solely from lack of documentation.

Preserve committed wearer presentation as product state independently of cultural suitability.

The planned Cultural Knowledge Supplement v1.1 is intended to add:

`garment × wearer × period × region × occasion × styling element × evidence`

Until that supplement is approved and integrated, research discussion is not production policy.

## Accessories

Do not use a single undifferentiated accessory pool as historical truth.

A styling element may eventually carry:

- garment compatibility,
- wearer compatibility,
- period,
- region,
- occasion,
- social context,
- historical status,
- evidence status,
- source references.

Research hypotheses must not become hard runtime rules merely because they were discussed.

## Commercial and stage practice

Use explicit labels for non-historical contexts when needed:

- heritage revival,
- contemporary reinterpretation,
- stage/performance costume,
- commercial practice.

These may be useful product inputs, but they must not be silently promoted to historical canon.

## Generated images

A generated image can show whether a requested trait appears visually.

It cannot prove a historical fact, historical accessory use, wearer canon, textile provenance, or symbolism.

Generated images are visual outputs, not cultural evidence.

## LLM behavior

LLM pretrained knowledge is not silent project knowledge.

If approved project knowledge is insufficient, the correct product behavior is to acknowledge uncertainty.

For the planned AC Chat Assistant:

- retrieve approved AC knowledge,
- answer from that knowledge,
- say when the corpus is insufficient,
- do not fill gaps with unmarked general model knowledge.

## Change procedure

Before changing cultural production logic:

1. identify the claim,
2. identify its evidence status,
3. identify source fit,
4. classify the claim as historical fact, interpretation, contemporary recommendation, or unresolved,
5. update the approved machine-readable layer,
6. add regression coverage if behavior changes,
7. update relevant documentation.

Do not patch cultural behavior only inside a prompt string if the rule belongs in structured knowledge.
